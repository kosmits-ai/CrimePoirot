# CrimePoirot
## **Introduction**
My work for my diploma thesis _Detecting Vulnerabilities/Malware with Python_ . 
I used four open source projects from Github:
1. **GitLeaks** : Secret Detection like passwords, API keys, and tokens in git repos, files
2. **GuardDog** : Identification of malicious PyPI and npm packages or Go modules
3. **Safety** : Python dependency vulnerability scanner
4. **Bearer** : Static application security testing (SAST) tool that scans the source code and analyzes the data flows to discover, filter and prioritize security and privacy risks.
